# Weather Forecaster

DESCRIPTION:

In this program the user can enter a city name into the search bar and click enter to view that cities sky conditions and temperature.

CHALLENGES:

A huge challenge for me in this homework was finding a way to display the 5 day forecast into seperate cards and storing the persistant data locally.
